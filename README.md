We utilized **SolidWorks** to design a custom chassis that integrates the servo motors and electronics into a compact form factor.

* **Design Intent:** Minimized footprint to fit 9 motors within the span of 18 standard piano keys.
* **Mounting Strategy:** Designed custom brackets for the SG90 servos to ensure rigid mounting, preventing mechanical "play" (wobble) during high-speed actuation.
* **Simulation:** Validated the servo horn travel paths in CAD to ensure the 55° (CW) and 60° (CCW) angles would perfectly strike the key centers without collision.

## 🔧 Technical Breakdown

### 1. Kinematics & Actuation
* **Optimization:** Solved hardware constraints by designing a **Bi-directional Actuation** mechanism. Each Servo controls two distinct outputs (CW → Key A, CCW → Key B), effectively doubling the system's mechanical resolution.
* **Hardware:** 9x SG90 Micro Servos with custom direct-drive horns.

### 2. Power Integrity & Safety
* **Problem:** Non-linear current demand (up to 4A peak) caused brownouts.
* **Solution:** Integrated an **XL4015 DC-DC Buck Converter** to step down 12V Li-Ion sources to a regulated 6V/5A rail. This isolated the high-current motor load from the microcontroller's logic.

### 3. Embedded Software & Architecture
* **Controller:** Arduino Uno.
* **Communication:** HC-05 Bluetooth Module (UART) using `SoftwareSerial`.
* **Latency:** Tuned signal timing (120ms actuation window) to ensure responsive playback.
